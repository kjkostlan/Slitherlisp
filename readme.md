# Python metaprogramming tools.

This project is very much a WIP.

Main tools:

1. Read Python code into lisp-like abstract syntax trees, *allow full lisp-like manipulation of them*, and blit back as a string.

2. (planned) Allow Clojure-like nested quotes-unquotes, with some modifications to account for Python's non parenthetical syntax.
